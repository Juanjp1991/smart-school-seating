# Implementation Plan & Status Tracking

## Current Implementation Strategy

### Skip Stories 3.4 & 3.5 - Move to Story 4.1

**Decision Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Reason:** To accelerate development by focusing on data display features before implementing the complex rule application engine.

#### Stories Being Temporarily Skipped:
- **Story 3.4 (Apply Rules):** "As a teacher, I want to press a button to automatically place students according to my prioritized rules, so that I can generate an optimized seating plan."
- **Story 3.5 (Toggle Rule):** "As a teacher, I want to be able to temporarily disable a rule without deleting it, so that I can experiment with different seating arrangements."

#### Story Being Implemented Instead:
- **Story 4.1 (Toggle Data On):** "As a teacher, I want to select specific data points from a display menu, so that I can see this information directly on the seating chart."

### Rationale for This Approach

1. **Faster Value Delivery**: Data display features provide immediate visual value to teachers
2. **Technical Foundation**: Data display capabilities will support future rule-based placement
3. **Complexity Management**: Rule application algorithm is complex and can be built separately
4. **User Experience**: Teachers can manually arrange students while seeing relevant data

### Future Implementation Plan for Stories 3.4 & 3.5

#### **Story 3.4 - Apply Rules Engine**
- **Planned for:** Sprint 5 or later
- **Dependencies:** Story 4.1 (data display), Stories 3.1-3.3 (rule management)
- **Key Components:**
  - Placement algorithm implementation
  - Integration with existing rule system
  - Performance optimization for large classes
  - User feedback during placement process

#### **Story 3.5 - Rule Toggle Functionality**
- **Planned for:** Sprint 5 or later
- **Dependencies:** Story 3.4 (apply rules)
- **Key Components:**
  - Rule activation/deactivation UI
  - Rule priority persistence
  - Real-time rule state management
  - Batch rule operations

### Current Sprint Status

#### **Sprint 4: Toggles, Export & Finalization**
- ‚úÖ **Story 4.1**: Toggle Data On - **IN DEVELOPMENT**
- ‚è≥ **Story 4.2**: Toggle Data Off - **PLANNED**
- ‚è≥ **Story 5.1**: Export PDF - **PLANNED**
- ‚è≥ **Story 5.2**: Backup Data - **PLANNED**
- ‚è≥ **Story 5.3**: Restore Data - **PLANNED**

#### **Deferred to Future Sprint**
- üîÑ **Story 3.4**: Apply Rules - **PLANNED FOR FUTURE**
- üîÑ **Story 3.5**: Toggle Rule - **PLANNED FOR FUTURE**

### Impact on Architecture

The architecture remains compatible with future rule implementation:
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Rules store already exists with proper structure
- ‚úÖ **Component Architecture**: Rule components can be extended
- ‚úÖ **Service Layer**: Rule service pattern established
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework**: Existing test patterns support rule testing

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Story 4.1**: Implement data display functionality
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all team members understand the plan
3. **Prepare for Rule Implementation**: Research placement algorithms
4. **Plan Future Sprint**: Allocate resources for Stories 3.4 & 3.5

### Notes for Development Team

- The rule application algorithm will be a significant technical challenge
- Consider performance implications for large classes (30+ students)
- Plan for edge cases in rule conflicts and constraint satisfaction
- User feedback during automatic placement will be crucial for adoption
