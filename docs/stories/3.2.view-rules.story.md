## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Sprint 3: The Intelligent Placement Engine** [From PRD]:
- This story builds upon Story 3.1 (Create Rule) to provide comprehensive rule management
- Establishes the foundation for Stories 3.3 (Prioritize Rules) and 3.5 (Toggle Rule)
- Part of the placement rules epic that enables intelligent seating arrangements
- Supports the teacher's need to review and understand their classroom management strategies

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 (Create Rule) completion:
- Rule data model and database schema are fully implemented with proper indexing
- Rule creation workflow is established with validation and error handling
- Rule types and constraints are properly defined and validated
- Database service patterns for rule operations are working efficiently
- Modal-based workflows for rule management are proven effective
- Student and roster management systems are fully functional

### Data Models
**Rule Interface** [Source: docs/prd/4-data-models-in-indexeddb.md]:
```typescript
interface Rule {
  id: string
  roster_id: string
  priority: number
  type: 'SEPARATE' | 'TOGETHER' | 'FRONT_ROW' | 'BACK_ROW' | 'NEAR_TEACHER' | 'NEAR_DOOR'
  student_ids: string[]
  is_active: boolean
  created_at: Date
  updated_at: Date
}

// Rule types with human-readable names
const RULE_TYPES = {
  SEPARATE: { name: 'Must Not Sit Together', description: 'Selected students should not be seated adjacent to each other' },
  TOGETHER: { name: 'Must Sit Together', description: 'Selected students should be seated in adjacent seats' },
  FRONT_ROW: { name: 'Front Row Preference', description: 'Selected students should be seated in the front rows' },
  BACK_ROW: { name: 'Back Row Preference', description: 'Selected students should be seated in the back rows' },
  NEAR_TEACHER: { name: 'Near Teacher', description: 'Selected students should be seated near the teacher desk' },
  NEAR_DOOR: { name: 'Near Door', description: 'Selected students should be seated near the classroom door' }
}
```

### Database Integration
**Enhanced Rule Service Methods** [Extending existing ruleService.ts]:
```typescript
interface RuleService {
  // Existing methods from Story 3.1
  createRule(rosterId: string, ruleData: Omit<Rule, 'id' | 'roster_id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'>): Promise<Rule>
  getRulesByRoster(rosterId: string): Promise<Rule[]>
  updateRule(ruleId: string, updates: Partial<Rule>): Promise<Rule>
  deleteRule(ruleId: string): Promise<void>
  validateRule(rule: Omit<Rule, 'id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'>): Promise<{ valid: boolean, errors: string[] }>
  
  // New methods for Story 3.2
  getFilteredRules(rosterId: string, filters: RuleFilters): Promise<Rule[]>
  searchRules(rosterId: string, query: string): Promise<Rule[]>
  getRulesByType(rosterId: string, type: RuleType): Promise<Rule[]>
  getActiveRules(rosterId: string): Promise<Rule[]>
  getInactiveRules(rosterId: string): Promise<Rule[]>
}

interface RuleFilters {
  status?: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'all'
  type?: RuleType | 'all'
  sortBy?: 'priority' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at' | 'type'
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc'
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
**Rule Viewing Error Scenarios:**
- Missing or invalid student references in rule data
- Database query failures during rule loading
- Filtering or sorting operation errors
- Large dataset performance issues

**User Experience for Errors:**
- Graceful fallback displays for missing student data
- Loading states during rule data fetching
- Clear error messages for viewing failures
- Performance indicators for large rule sets

### Future Considerations
**Rule Analytics Integration:**
- Consider adding rule usage statistics
- Plan for rule effectiveness metrics
- Design for rule conflict detection
- Prepare for bulk rule operations

**Enhanced Display Features:**
- Consider rule grouping by type or priority
- Plan for rule dependency visualization
- Design for rule impact preview
- Prepare for rule templates and presets

### Project Structure Notes
The current project structure aligns well with the proposed architecture:
- ✅ Component-based structure in `/components/rules/` directory
- ✅ Type definitions in `/types/rule.ts`
- ✅ Service layer in `/lib/ruleService.ts`
- ✅ Test files following established patterns
- ✅ Integration with existing roster management system
- ✅ Following established React/Next.js patterns
