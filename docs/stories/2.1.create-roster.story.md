## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Sprint 2: Student & Roster Management** [From PRD]:
- This story kicks off the roster management system
- Foundation for Stories 2.2 (Add Student) and 2.3 (Import CSV)
- Two-panel design pattern established in architecture document
- Follows local-first architecture with IndexedDB storage

### Data Model
**Roster Interface** [From PRD architecture]:
```typescript
interface Roster {
  id: string          // UUID for unique identification
  name: string        // User-provided roster name
  created_at: Date    // Creation timestamp
  updated_at: Date    // Last modification timestamp
}

// Database schema extension
interface RosterStore {
  id: string
  name: string
  created_at: string  // ISO string for IndexedDB
  updated_at: string  // ISO string for IndexedDB
}
```

### UI/UX Design
**Two-Panel Layout** [From PRD architecture]:
- Left Panel: List of all rosters with selection state
- Right Panel: Selected roster details (students will be added in Story 2.2)
- Follow design patterns established in layout editor
- Consistent with overall application styling

**Roster List Design**:
```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ My Rosters      │ Period 3 - Math          │
│                 │                          │
│ ► Period 1 - English    │ Students: 0              │
│ ► Period 2 - Science    │                          │
│ ► Period 3 - Math       │ [Add Student] [Import]   │
│ ► Period 5 - History    │                          │
│                 │ (Empty state message)    │
│ [+ New Roster]  │                          │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

### Database Integration
**IndexedDB Extension** [Building on existing db service]:
```typescript
// Add to existing dbService
interface DbService {
  // Existing layout methods...
  
  // New roster methods
  saveRoster(roster: Omit<Roster, 'id' | 'created_at' | 'updated_at'>): Promise<Roster>
  getAllRosters(): Promise<Roster[]>
  getRosterById(id: string): Promise<Roster | null>
  updateRoster(id: string, updates: Partial<Pick<Roster, 'name'>>): Promise<Roster>
  deleteRoster(id: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### Navigation Integration
**Route Structure**:
- Main app navigation should include `/rosters` link
- Use Next.js App Router patterns established in layout editor
- Consistent header/navigation with existing pages
- Breadcrumb: Home > Rosters

### Component Structure
**File Organization** [Following established patterns]:
```
/app/rosters/
  page.tsx              # Main roster management page

/components/roster/
  RosterList.tsx        # Left panel roster list
  RosterDetails.tsx     # Right panel roster details  
  RosterModal.tsx       # Modal for create/edit roster
  RosterItem.tsx        # Individual roster list item

/lib/
  db.ts                 # Extended with roster methods
```

### State Management
**Roster Page State**:
```typescript
const [rosters, setRosters] = useState<Roster[]>([])
const [selectedRosterId, setSelectedRosterId] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [showRosterModal, setShowRosterModal] = useState(false)
const [editingRoster, setEditingRoster] = useState<Roster | null>(null)
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)
const [notification, setNotification] = useState<NotificationState | null>(null)
```

### Validation & Error Handling
**Roster Name Validation**:
- Required field validation
- Maximum length limits (50 characters)
- Duplicate name prevention within user's rosters
- Trim whitespace from names
- Handle special characters appropriately

**Error Scenarios**:
- Database connection failures
- Roster creation/update errors  
- Network timeouts for operations
- Invalid roster name inputs
- Attempting to delete non-empty roster (future consideration)

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient roster list rendering for large numbers of rosters
- Lazy loading of student data for selected roster
- Optimized re-rendering on roster selection
- Debounced search/filter functionality (future enhancement)

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation for roster selection
- Screen reader support for roster list
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Focus management for modal workflows
- High contrast support for roster states

### User Experience Flow
1. Teacher navigates to `/rosters` page
2. Page loads with list of existing rosters (or empty state)
3. Teacher clicks "Create New Roster" button
4. Modal opens with roster name input field
5. Teacher enters name and clicks "Create"
6. New roster appears in list and is automatically selected
7. Right panel shows empty roster details
8. Teacher can edit roster name or create additional rosters

### Future Story Preparation
**Integration Points for Stories 2.2 & 2.3**:
- Right panel structure ready for student list display
- "Add Student" button placement prepared
- Database model ready for student association
- Modal patterns established for student operations
