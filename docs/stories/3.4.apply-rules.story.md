# Story 3.4: Apply Placement Rules

## Status
✅ **READY FOR REVIEW**

## Story
**As a** teacher,
**I want** to press a button to automatically place students according to my prioritized rules,
**so that** I can generate an optimized seating plan.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can press an "Auto Place" button to trigger automatic student placement
2. The system applies rules in priority order (highest priority first)
3. The algorithm attempts to satisfy as many rules as possible while filling seats
4. Visual feedback shows placement progress and which rules are being applied
5. Final seating arrangement displays which rules were successfully applied vs. conflicted
6. User can see a summary of rule satisfaction after placement is complete

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement placement algorithm core logic (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create placement algorithm that processes rules by priority
  - [x] Implement constraint satisfaction logic for different rule types
  - [x] Add conflict detection and resolution strategies
  - [x] Handle edge cases (insufficient seats, impossible constraints)
- [x] Task 2: Create Auto Place UI button and controls (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add "Auto Place" button to seating plan editor
  - [x] Implement placement confirmation dialog
  - [x] Add option to clear current placements before auto-placement
  - [x] Handle disabled state when no rules or students exist
- [x] Task 3: Implement placement progress feedback (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create progress indicator during placement calculation
  - [x] Show which rule is currently being processed
  - [x] Display real-time placement updates on the seating chart
  - [x] Add cancel/abort functionality during placement
- [x] Task 4: Build rule satisfaction reporting (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Track which rules were successfully applied
  - [x] Identify conflicting rules and reasons for conflicts
  - [x] Create summary dialog showing placement results
  - [x] Add visual indicators on seating chart for rule compliance
- [x] Task 5: Testing and validation (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Unit tests for placement algorithm logic
  - [x] Integration tests for UI interactions
  - [x] Performance tests with large numbers of students/rules
  - [x] Edge case testing (empty rosters, conflicting rules)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Sprint 3: The Intelligent Placement Engine** [From PRD]:
- This story is the culmination of the placement rules epic
- Builds directly on Stories 3.1 (Create Rule), 3.2 (View Rules), and 3.3 (Prioritize Rules)
- Provides the core value proposition of automated intelligent seating arrangements
- Integrates with the existing layout system from Sprint 1 and roster system from Sprint 2

### Previous Story Dependencies
From Story 3.3 (Prioritize Rules) completion:
- Rule priority system is fully functional with drag-and-drop reordering
- Database operations for priority management are established and efficient
- Rule data model includes priority field that drives algorithm execution order
- Visual hierarchy and status indicators provide foundation for rule satisfaction display

From Story 3.2 (View Rules) completion:
- Rule display components provide foundation for satisfaction reporting
- Rule filtering and search capabilities can be leveraged for result analysis
- Database service patterns for rule operations are established

From Story 3.1 (Create Rule) completion:
- Complete rule data model with all rule types implemented
- Rule validation and error handling patterns established
- Modal-based workflows proven effective for complex interactions

### Data Models
**Placement Algorithm Types**:
```typescript
interface PlacementResult {
  success: boolean
  placements: StudentPlacement[]
  ruleSatisfaction: RuleSatisfactionReport[]
  conflicts: RuleConflict[]
  unplacedStudents: string[]
  executionTime: number
}

interface StudentPlacement {
  studentId: string
  seatPosition: { row: number; col: number }
  appliedRules: string[] // Rule IDs that influenced this placement
}

interface RuleSatisfactionReport {
  ruleId: string
  satisfied: boolean
  reason?: string
  affectedStudents: string[]
}

interface RuleConflict {
  ruleIds: string[]
  conflictType: 'IMPOSSIBLE' | 'COMPETING' | 'INSUFFICIENT_SEATS'
  description: string
}

interface PlacementProgress {
  currentStep: string
  rulesProcessed: number
  totalRules: number
